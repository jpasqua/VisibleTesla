                The Charge Tab
            </h1>
            <p>
                The Charge Tab allows you to monitor and control your car's charging process. It let's you manually start or stop charging and it lets you set the charge target (the level to which you want the car to charge). Charging can also be started or stopped on a schedule using the <a href="SchedulerTab.html">Scheduler Tab</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are quite a few pieces of data in the Charge Tab as shown in the screen shot below. In this example, the car is not connected to a power source.

                <li>It has been discovered that the range is derived slightly differently while the car is being charged vs. when it is not. This can cause the range to seem to drop by a small amount immediately after charging stops.
                </li>
                <li>When charging with a 3-phase current source, the interpretation of some of these fields may not seem to be correct. Note that VisibleTesla does not compute any of the values reported here. It simply displays the values reported by your car.

                <li>
                    Vehicles with firmware 5.9 or later have the ability to give a "usable battery level" reading. Tesla says:
                    <blockquote>
                        In cold weather, some of the stored energy in your Model S’s battery may not be available on your drive because the battery is too cold. When this happens, a portion of the battery meter will appear blue and the range value will have a snowflake image next to it. If your car is plugged in, you can heat your battery using wall power by turning on the Climate Control via the mobile app.
                    </blockquote>In VisibleTesla, the charge tab reflects this with a snowflake over the battery gauge. When you see the snowflake, the gauge is displaying the usable battery level.
                </li>
            </ul>

                The following screen shot shows the car when connected to a power source but not charging. Note that below the "Charging Data" table there is an indication that the car has a charge scheduled. This refers to the car's charge scheduler, not to the <a href="SchedulerTab.html">Scheduler Tab</a>.
